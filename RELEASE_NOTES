1.93d: 13 June 2008

* Thanks to Seth Olsen for contributing the code to sort the variables 
  menus.

1.75: 20 March 1999

* This release adds much improved support for Linux boxes.  In general,
  any depth of your server should work -- 8, 16, 24, or 32 bits.
  Let me know if you have a problem with this.

* Support has been added for converting the indicated time to a calendar
  date IF the netCDF file's time axis has a "units" attribute that follows
  the udunits conventions (see info on udunits at: 
  http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/udunits/index.html).  Time units 
  in this syntax are typically something like "days since 1990-01-01".
  If your data file follows these conventions, then the day number will
  automatically be shown as a calendar date rather than the (not useful)
  day number.  I.e., "10 Jan 1995" will be shown instead of "Day 3783" 
  (or whatever).  This should work in the X-Y popup graph as well, but
  not yet in the range-setting popups.

* Compilation on Crays now works out of the box.

* Fixed but that caused core dumps after selecting variables that
  have all 0 as all their entries.
